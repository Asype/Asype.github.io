    "AboutText": "Hi, I’m Jacob Miller, a full-stack software engineer and Computer Science student from Seattle Pacific University. I’m passionate about building user-focused software that balances intuitive design with robust functionality.<br><br>Previously, I worked as a Junior Engineer at <strong>3NUM</strong>, I’ve contributed to multiple projects in their identity and messaging suite, working across the stack, participating in agile standups via Slack, and delivering features through Linear-based sprint planning.<br><br>I co-developed <strong>WinterArk</strong>, a cross-platform fitness app built with Flutter and Node.js, featuring workout tracking, roast reminders, a social reels page, and real-time chat. I worked on both frontend and backend, including secure API design and background task handling.<br><br>I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative teams where I can design, code, and continuously improve products. From Flutter interfaces to scalable Node.js backends, I care about clean code, team feedback, and building things that work beautifully."
